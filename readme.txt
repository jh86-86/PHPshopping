This project will be a simple ecommerce website for cars. 

It will produce an array of objects of cars with vehicle data. 

It will also include a payment system from paid in full, to pay monthly or a link to a finance comapny for the vehicle.

It is being written in a VScode text editor, on a MAC, using MAMP. 

Inital commits to git will be experimentation and tutorials I have learned from
